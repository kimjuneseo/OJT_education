    Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. 
    It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and 
    component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.
